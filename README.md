# Outlook-AutosaveAttachments
Outlook VBA code for saving attachments from new messages.

### How To Use
You can copy this code into Outlook by pressing ALT-F11 to bring up the VBA scripting window.
Please make sure you read the documentation in the code before using.  You need to define
your own filters for parsing new or selected emails for attachment saving.

There is also a GUID generator in the code you can use to append to filenames, or simply
use to name the files instead of the filename.  This is useful if the attachments always
have the same name, but vary in content.  In this situation, you would not want to
overwrite the file each time it is saved, so a unique identifer needs to be used to prevent
this.  You can, of course, use your own method for naming the save file for the attachments.

I will post a video when possible on how to use this script if you are not familiar with coding
but need use of this.
